## ReferenceR

ReferenceR is an application designed to assist artists who are looking for visual references to start or enhance their creations. Through the platform, users can explore galleries published on specialized websites, such as portfolios of photographers, illustrators, and other professionals in the field.

#### API Repository
https://github.com/jonasnascc/ReferenceR-API

The goal of ReferenceR is to allow users to select images from different websites and organize their own reference galleries. The photos are obtained through scraping and displayed directly in the application, enabling the creation of customized collections for artistic use.

One of the main features of the application is Chrono Shuffle, a dynamic, shuffled, and timed presentation of the images in a collection. Users can set the display time for each image before the next one appears, providing continuous and dynamic training to improve skills such as gesture drawing, light and shadow studies, and perspective.

Currently, ReferenceR extracts images exclusively from DeviantArt, a community rich in artistic content, where both professionals and amateurs share their work, offering a diverse source of inspiration.

This project was developed as a personal learning experience, allowing me to explore various web development concepts in a practical way. ReferenceR should not be used for commercial purposes or made available to the public due to copyright issues.

### Gesture Drawing

It's no secret that the more you practice a technique, the more you master it, and this is no different when you need to practice methods that make your drawings more expressive, without them looking artificial or cold.

A great way to practice gestures is to draw as many pose references as possible. In a short period of time, you can analyze the flow of the drawing and identify the lines of action. What artists do is impose a period of time on each reference to study it and extract its essence. Usually, this time is short, like 30 seconds, and in that time the artist can sketch each pose, and thus gain some experience. This practice greatly improves the development of future drawings.
